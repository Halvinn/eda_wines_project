Use exploratory data analysis techniques to investigate a dataset about wines to determine which attributes most affect the quality of the wine. Attributes such as alcohol or sulfur content, acidity, residual sugars, density etc.

The project is divided into the following sections:
1. Abstract
2. Univariate Analysis  - where I explore individual variables
3. Bivariate Analysis  - explore relationships between two variables.
4. Multivariate Analysis - relationsips among three or more variables for example between quality, alcohol and sulfur dioxide.
5. Reflections - short section explaining my analysis and the results I found.
